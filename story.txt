WHAT THIS STORY IS ABOUT

It was Sam Marlowe's fate to fall in love with a girl on the R.M.S. "Atlantic" (New York to Southampton) who had ideals. 
She was looking for a man just like Sir Galahad, and refused to be put off with any inferior substitute. A lucky accident 
on the first day of the voyage placed Sam for the moment in the Galahad class, but he could not stay the pace.

He follows Billie Bennett "around," scheming, blundering and hoping, so does the parrot faced young man Bream Mortimer, Sam's rival.

Reader Reviews

****.
An excellent book! The premise of Wodehouse’s romantic comedies are about all the same; boy loves girl, 
there’s competitive suitors &/or other dilemmas, and at the very end the girl expresses her full love for the boy. 
Despite that there will be no surprises, doesn’t diminish from his books whatsoever, the story is always captivating 
and pleasure on every page.
