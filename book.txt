"Jeeves," I said, "may I speak frankly?"

"Certainly, sir."

"What I have to say may wound you."

"Not at all, sir."

"Well, then----"

No--wait. Hold the line a minute. I've gone off the rails.

I don't know if you have had the same experience, but the snag I always come up against when I'm telling a story is 
this dashed difficult problem of where to begin it. It's a thing you don't want to go wrong over, because one false 
step and you're sunk. I mean, if you fool about too long at the start, trying to establish atmosphere, as they call
 it, and all that sort of rot, you fail to grip and the customers walk out on you.

Get off the mark, on the other hand, like a scalded cat, and your public is at a loss. It simply raises its eyebrows, 
and can't make out what you're talking about.

And in opening my report of the complex case of Gussie Fink-Nottle, Madeline Bassett, my Cousin Angela, my Aunt Dahlia, 
my Uncle Thomas, young Tuppy Glossop and the cook, Anatole, with the above spot of dialogue, I see that I have made the 
second of these two floaters.

I shall have to hark back a bit. And taking it for all in all and weighing this against that, I suppose the affair may 
be said to have had its inception, if inception is the word I want, with that visit of mine to Cannes. If I hadn't gone 
to Cannes, I shouldn't have met the Bassett or bought that white mess jacket, and Angela wouldn't have met her shark, 
and Aunt Dahlia wouldn't have played baccarat.

Reader Review

Despite the popularity, the Jeeves stories are not my favorite of Wodehouse and I love 
his romantic novels so much more. Jeeves and Wooster were entertaining enough for me to 
read both this and My Man Jeeves, but definitely not the best of Wodehouse in my opinion
